We spent the weekend creating a genetic algorithm to solve the problem of finding places for Tesla stations, then wrote a paper on our process. Primarly, this consisted of the three of us, in a room, programming or reading research papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an absolute blast, although I do think it's quite easy to go wrong with your team. My team member even said she considered not asking me because we were good friends and she didn't want to ruin that. I'm glad she did decide to ask me, and even after spending 4 straight days with my team mates, I still enjoyed their company. It's a rare kind of friend that you will enjoy working with for that long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to put the paper up here, to share our hard work. My collaborators on this project were Connor Hudson and Katie Gray. I primarily worked on generating the car data to put into our genetic model, and also wrote the sections about expanding Tesla in the US and the letter to the environmental committee. &lt;/p&gt;
